# Machine_Learning_Practice_Repository
In this I done some model using different different algorithms of machine learning.
The very first project is of simple linear regression in which I predict weight on the basis of height.
In secound project I done the mulptiple linear regression.
In Third project I work on hr_data were i try to build a model by using logistic regression and Random forest.
