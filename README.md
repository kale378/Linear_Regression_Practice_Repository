# Machine_Learning_Practice_Repository
In this I done some model using different different algorithms of machine learning.
The very first project is of simple linear regression in which I predict weight on the basis of height.
In secound project I done the mulptiple linear regression.
In Third project I work on hr_data were i try to build a model by using logistic regression and Random forest.
In Fourth project I work on Salary data, where on the basis of Years of experience I predict the salary. By using Regression algorithms.
In Fifth Project I worked on Sales data , where based on time I predict the sales price by using Regressions Algorithmns.
In sixth Project I worked on Car Price Prediction, He I predict the price of car based different Variables. Here in this project there are some wrong names of column are given I deal with that, and there is also a 'Multicollinearity' Problem is there I also deal with that by removing highly correlated variables and which are not much more Important.Here In this project I used multiple algorithms to predict the car price.
